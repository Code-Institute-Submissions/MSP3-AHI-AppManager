### UX

#### User stories
As a staff member, I expect to be able to create, edit, update, and delete accounts, appointments, and appointment purposes. 
As a vet, I expect to be able to view, edit and update appointments assigned to me for my clients. 

#### Strategy
The goal of this app is to make it as easy as possible for veterinary practice administrators or vets to create, view, update and delete appointments for their clients. 

#### Scope
This app will be aimed at veterinary practices, primary at administrative staff but will also be user friendly for vets themselves. 

#### Structure
This is a multipage app which includes a navigation with dropdown menus and simple page footer.  Each subsequent page is accessible through the app home page and allows users to create, update and deleted records as it is linked to MongoDB database. 

#### Skeleton
Desktop and mobile wireframes have been created <a href="https://github.com/lisaannbyrne1/MSP3-AHI-TaskManager/blob/master/static/wireframe/Wireframe.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a>

#### Surface
The background of the page is white with the navigation and footer sections in green to provide definition. The font for the navigation and footer is white which stands out against the green background.  Each of the buttons are also coloured in green to stand out on the white background and provide synchronicity.  The font in the body of the app is black for clear and easy reading. 

#### Technologies
* HTML
* CSS/Materialize
* JavaScript/jQuery
* Python + Flask
* Mongo DB

### Features
The main features of this page are that it follows the users to interact with the database through CRUD.  It allows users to create, read, update, and delete records to and from the database. 

#### Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to include a log in page for clients to view and reschedule their appointments directly through the app.
